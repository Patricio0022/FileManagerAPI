## Project Overview
This project is a Spring Boot application that enables users to make requests to a JSON API, process the responses, and save the results to a local directory in various file formats (currently supporting JSON, PDF, and TXT). It provides a flexible solution that can be easily adapted to work with multiple APIs and file types.

## Key Features
API Integration: Seamlessly connect to any API that returns data in JSON format.
Customizable Output: Process and format the API response into one of the supported file formats: JSON, PDF, or TXT.
Local Storage: Automatically saves the processed data to a specified directory on the system.

## Project Goals
The objective of this project is to deepen my knowledge in Front-End development with React and TypeScript, Back-End development using Java and Spring Boot, and API communications.
